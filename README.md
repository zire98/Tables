ðŸ“Š Exercise: Semantic and Accessible HTML Table
This exercise involved creating a data table about the planets in our solar system, following semantic HTML structure and accessibility best practices.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Learnings
How to structure a complex table using <caption>, <thead>, <tbody>, along with colspan and rowspan for grouping.

Correct usage of the scope attribute to define whether a header applies to a column (col), row (row), or group (rowgroup, colgroup).

How to use id and headers attributes to explicitly associate data cells (<td>) with their corresponding headers (<th>).

Improved accessibility for screen readers and assistive technologies.

Writing clean, semantic, and maintainable HTML code.

ðŸ§± Table Structure Highlights
<caption> provides a description of the tableâ€™s purpose.

<th scope="col"> defines column headers.

<th scope="row"> defines row headers (planet names).

<th scope="rowgroup"> is used for logical grouping of rows (e.g., "Terrestrial planets").

Each <td> uses headers="..." to associate the data cell with its related headers via their id.

ðŸ¦¾ Benefits
Enhanced web accessibility (complies with WCAG standards).

Better user experience for visually impaired users.

More readable and professional HTML.

Solid foundation for dynamic styling or scripting with CSS/JavaScript.
